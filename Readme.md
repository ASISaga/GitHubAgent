# GitHub Agent

GitHub Agent is a smart assistant that can help you manage and automate various aspects of your projects hosted on GitHub.
This agent will be used to automatically push agent generated code to the respective GitHub repository 

Here are some tasks a GitHub agent can handle:

1. **Issue Management**: Automatically create, update, and close issues based on certain triggers or events.
2. **Pull Request Review**: Assist in reviewing pull requests by automatically checking for code standards, running tests, and suggesting changes.
3. **CI/CD Automation**: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines to automatically build, test, and deploy code changes.
4. **Code Analysis**: Perform static code analysis to identify potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, or code smells.
5. **Documentation Updates**: Automatically update or generate project documentation based on code changes or new commits.
6. **Notifications**: Send notifications to team members about important events, such as failed builds, new issues, or pull requests needing review.
7. **Dependency Management**: Monitor and update project dependencies to ensure the codebase stays up-to-date with the latest versions.
